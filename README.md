# HarvardX CS50's Introduction To Computer Science

## Week 2 Problem Set: Bulbs

### The Basics
The simplest *base* is base-1, or *unary*; to write a number, *N*, in base-1, we would simply write N consecutive `1`s. So the number `4` in base-1 would be written as `1111`, and the number `12` as `111111111111`. Think of it like counting on your fingers or tallying up a score with marks on a board.

You might see why base-1 isnâ€™t used much nowadays. (The numbers get rather long!) Instead, a common convention is base-10, or decimal. In base-10, each *digit* is multiplied by some power of 10, in order to represent larger numbers. For instance, 123 is short for 123 = 1 * 10<sup>2</sup> + 2 10<sup>1</sup> + 3 10<sup>0</sup>. 
.

Changing base is as simple as changing the 10 above to a different number. For instance, if you wrote `123` in base-4, the number youâ€™d really be writing is 123 = 1 * 4<sup>2</sup> + 2 4<sup>1</sup> + 3 4<sup>0</sup>, which is equal to the decimal number 27.

Computers, though, use base-2, or *binary*. In binary, writing `123` would be a mistake, since binary numbers can only have `0`s and `1`s. But the process of figuring out exactly what decimal number a binary number stands for is exactly the same. For instance, the number `10101` in base-2 represents 1 * 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>0</sup>, which is equal to the decimal number 21.

### Encoding a Message
Light bulbs can only be on or off. In other words, light bulbs represent two possible states; either the bulb is on, or the bulb is off, just as binary numbers are either 1 or 0. Weâ€™ll have to find a way to encode text as a sequence of binary numbers.

Letâ€™s write a program called `bulbs` that takes a message and converts it to a set of bulbs that we could show to an unsuspecting audience. Weâ€™ll do it in two steps:

- The first step consists of turning the text into decimal numbers. Letâ€™s say we want to encode the message `HI!`. Luckily, we already have a convention in place for how to do this, [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/). Notice that `H` is represented by the decimal number `72`, `I` is represented by `73`, and `!` is represented by `33`.
- The next step involves taking our decimal numbers (like `72`, `73`, and `33`) and converting them into equivalent binary numbers, which only use 0s and 1s. For the sake of having a consistent number of bits in each of our binary numbers, assume that each decimal is represented with 8 bits. `72` is `01001000`, `73` is `01001001`, and `33` is `00100001`.

Lastly, weâ€™ll interpret these binary numbers as instructions for the light bulbs on stage; 0 is off, 1 is on. (Youâ€™ll find that bulbs.c includes a print_bulb function thatâ€™s been implemented for you, which takes in a `0` or `1` and outputs emoji representing light bulbs.)

Hereâ€™s an example of how the completed program might work. Unlike the Sanders stage, weâ€™ll print one byte per line for clarity.
```
# ./bulbs
Message: HI!
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡
âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡
```
To check our work, we can read a bulb thatâ€™s on (ðŸŸ¡) as a 1 and bulb thatâ€™s off (âš«) as a 0. Then HI! became
```
01001000
01001001
00100001
```
which is precisely what weâ€™d expect.

Another example:
```
# ./bulbs
Message: HI MOM
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡
âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«âš«âš«
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡âš«ðŸŸ¡
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡âš«ðŸŸ¡
```
Notice that all characters are included in the lightbulb instructions, including nonalphabetical characters like spaces (00100000).
### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a compiler for C programs. Some popular compilers include GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++.
2. Clone the repo.
3. `cd` into the respective directory.
4. Compile the code `gcc -o caesar caesar.c`.
5. Start the program `./caesar`
